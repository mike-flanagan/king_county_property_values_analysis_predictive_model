## Overview  
This project will make a predictive model for property values in Kings County in Seattle, WA. Using a dataset of various property features in the area, I will use inferrential statistics to develop a predictive model that will be tested on a holdout dataset.

## Motivation  
To see if property sales in King's County may be predicted using data from former property sales.

## Data  
The testing dataset used includes multiple features for several thousand property sales in King's County.

## Methods  
My EDA uses descriptive and inferrential statistics to evaluate a test dataset, which is then used to develop a predictive model using linear regression.
Tools used include Python, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, StatsModels, and SciKit Learn.
