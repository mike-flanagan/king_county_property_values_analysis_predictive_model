## Overview  
This project will make a predictive model for property values in King County in Seattle, WA. Using a dataset of various property features in the area, I will use inferrential statistics to develop a predictive model that will be tested on a holdout dataset.

## Motivation  
To see if property sales in King County may be predicted using data from former property sales.

## Data  
The testing dataset used includes multiple features for several thousand property sales in King County.

## Methods  
My methodology implements the CRISP-DM model for exploratory data analysis, cleaning, modeling, and evaluation. I use descriptive and inferrential statistics to evaluate a test dataset, including hypothesis testing with t-tests and analysis of variance. From my inferrences, I developed predictive models with use of polynomial features, categorical dummy variables, as well as several engineered features. Finally, I deployed and evaluated linear regression models using a filter method F-test to find K best, and wrapper method recursive feature elimination cross-validation.
Tools used include Python, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, StatsModels, and SciKit Learn. Visualizations were created with MatPlotLib and Seaborn.
